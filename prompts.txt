            "What are the Characteristics of a Magnet? Attraction: Magnets attract magnetic materials (e.g., iron, steel). Non-magnetic materials (e.g., gold, aluminium, silver, copper, glass, rubber, clay, wood, plastic) are not attracted to magnets. Poles: Every magnet has two poles: North Pole (N) and South Pole (S). The attraction is strongest at the poles. Direction: A freely suspended magnet points in the North-South direction. A compass can help identify the poles of a magnet. Interaction: Like poles repel each other (N-N or S-S). Unlike poles attract each other (N-S).",
            "How Can We Test the Strength of a Magnet? Method: Compare how many magnetic objects (e.g., thumbtacks) each magnet can attract. The one attracting more objects is stronger.",
            "How Can We Make Magnets? Natural and Man-Made: Some magnets are natural, while others are made from magnetic materials. Making a magnetic object into a magnet is called magnetization.",
            "Methods to Make Magnets: Stroke Method: Materials Needed: Magnet, magnetic object (e.g., iron rod), steel clips. Steps: Stroke the iron rod with one pole of the magnet several times in the same direction. Test by bringing the rod near steel clips to see if it attracts them. Strength: More strokes make the magnet stronger. Electrical Method: Materials Needed: Magnetic object (e.g., iron rod), electrical wire, batteries, steel clips. Steps: Coil the wire around the nail. Connect wire ends to the battery. Test by bringing the nail near paper clips to see if it attracts them. Strength: More wire turns or more batteries make the magnet stronger.",
            "How are Magnets Useful to Us? Applications: Holding Objects: Fridge magnets, doorstops. Lifting Objects: Huge electromagnets in scrap yards. Direction: Compass. Storing Information: Credit cards, ATM cards, MRT fare cards. Medical: Removing magnetic objects from wounds.",
            "Open-Ended Questions: Magnet Interaction Test: Object Likely to be a Magnet: Object C. Reason for No Reaction: Object A is non-magnetic. Labeling Poles: Pole i) North Pole. Pole ii) South Pole."

            "What is Light? Definition: Light is a form of energy. Purpose: We need light to see things.",
            "What are Some Sources of Light? Natural Sources: The Sun: Main source of light during the day. Stars: All stars, including the Sun, give off their own light. Bioluminescent Animals: Some animals, like fireflies, produce their own light. Artificial Sources: Burning Fuel: Wood and coal can be burnt to give off light. Electricity: Electric bulbs and lamps give off light when switched on.",
            "How Does Light Help Us See? Process: We see an object when light from the object enters our eyes. This can happen if the object is a light source or if it reflects light from another source. Reflection: Example: A box is seen because it reflects light from a torch into our eyes. Light's Path: Light travels in a straight line. If obstacles block the straight path, light cannot pass through.",
            "How Much Light Can Pass Through Different Types of Materials? Categories of Materials: Transparent: Allow most light to pass through (e.g., glass, clear plastic, air, water). Translucent: Allow some light to pass through (e.g., some plastics, cloth, thin paper, frosted glass). Opaque: Do not allow light to pass through (e.g., clay, metal, wood, rubber). Measurement: The amount of light passing through an object can be measured using a light sensor connected to a datalogger.",
            "How are Shadows Formed? Process: Shadows form when light is blocked by an object. Shadows always form on the side opposite to the light source. The shape of the shadow is similar to the shape of the object.",
            "How Can We Change the Shapes and Sizes of Shadows? Shape Variation: An object's shadow shape depends on the angle at which light shines on it. Size Variation: Bigger Shadows: When the object is nearer to the light source or further from the screen. Smaller Shadows: When the object is further from the light source or nearer to the screen. Sun's Position: Shadows are shorter at noon when the Sun is directly overhead and longer in the morning and evening due to the angle of sunlight.",
            "Open-Ended Questions: Shadow Formation: Explanation: Object A, being opaque, blocks light and forms a shadow on the screen. Shadow Size Change: Change in Size: When Object A is moved to position Y, its shadow will become bigger. Material Classification: Objects Based on Light Passage: Allows Most Light to Pass Through: Object C. Allows Some Light to Pass Through: Object B. Does Not Allow Light to Pass Through: Object A."

            "How Does Heat Flow? Flow Direction: Heat always flows from a hotter place or object to a colder one until they reach the same temperature. Examples: Cooling: A glass of warm water cools down as heat flows to the surroundings. Heating: A pot of tap water heats up as it gains heat from the fire.",
            "What are Some Sources of Heat? Natural Source: The Sun keeps the Earth warm. Burning Fuels: Wood, coal, oil, and natural gas produce heat. Electrical Appliances: Examples include electric irons, ovens, hair dryers, rice cookers, toasters, and stoves. Light Sources: Candles and light bulbs also produce heat.",
            "What is the Difference Between Heat and Temperature? Heat: A form of energy that makes things hot. Temperature: A measurement of how hot or cold something is. Measurement: Thermometers: Used to measure temperature accurately. Types of Thermometers: Clinical Thermometer: Measures body temperature. Laboratory Thermometer: Measures temperature of objects and substances in experiments. Unit: Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (°C).",
            "What are Some Effects of Heat Gain and Heat Loss? Temperature Change: Heat Gain: Increases the temperature of an object. Heat Loss: Decreases the temperature of an object. Changes in States of Matter: Examples: Ice (solid) melts to water (liquid). Water boils to become water vapor (gas). Solid wax melts to liquid wax.",
            "How Do We Use the Knowledge of Expansion and Contraction in Our Daily Lives? Thermometers: Contain a liquid (like mercury or alcohol) that expands when heated and contracts when cooled. Opening Bottle Lids: Heating the lid expands it, making it easier to open. Precautions: Overhead Cables: Hung loosely to prevent snapping when they contract in cold weather. Railway Tracks: Have gaps to prevent buckling when the metal expands on hot days.",
            "What are Good and Poor Conductors of Heat? Good Conductors: Materials that allow heat to flow through them easily (e.g., metals like steel and nickel). Uses: Making cooking utensils to quickly transfer heat to food. Poor Conductors: Materials that do not allow heat to flow through them easily (e.g., rubber, air, plastic, wood, fabrics like nylon). Uses: Making winter clothing to trap heat, and containers to keep food warm or cold.",
